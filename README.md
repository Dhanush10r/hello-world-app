# Hello World App

DevOps is a collaborative approach that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance the speed, quality, and reliability of software delivery. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to streamline workflows and improve communication across teams. By leveraging tools and practices such as containerization, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring, DevOps enables organizations to quickly adapt to market demands and deliver high-quality software with reduced risks. This methodology fosters a culture of collaboration, accountability, and innovation, ensuring that development and operations teams work seamlessly toward shared goals.
